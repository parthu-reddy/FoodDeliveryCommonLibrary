/**
 * Wire shape tolerates fields it does not declare -- {@code eventType} above all.
 *
 * <p>Repeating eventType in the body is this platform's convention: EventPayloadUtils records 28
 * production call sites and 6 message contracts doing it, WebhookProcessingService adds it with
 * {@code valueToTree(event).put("eventType", ...)}, and OutboxProcessor enforces only that it must
 * not CONTRADICT the outbox row (ADR 002). So the class genuinely receives a field it has no
 * component for.
 *
 * <p>Declared here rather than left to the ObjectMapper's global setting. Boot's mapper disables
 * FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, but a plain {@code new ObjectMapper()} does not, and several test
 * harnesses build one -- PaymentEventConsumerRefundIdempotencyTest threw
 * UnrecognizedPropertyException on exactly this field. Binding must not depend on which mapper
 * happens to be wired.
